## How to run

To run this project, you will need to add a `.env` file containing the following:

- A mongoDB URI string (attainable by signing up to mongoDB and creating a cluster) named `MONGO_URI`
- Optional, but nice to have, a port number under the name PORT

Here's how it should look like:

```
MONGO_URI=yourMongoURIHere
PORT=8080
```
